<p>Whether you are shopping for a silhouette designed as a line, empire or sheath, long sleeves, cap or short sleeves, there are also the modest designed. A jewish wedding is a joyous occasion, but it can be challenging for orthodox jewish women to find modest bridal gowns that adhere to the tzniyus (modesty) rules that they live by.
