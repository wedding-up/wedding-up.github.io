<p>The circular ring has neither a start nor finish, which is emblematic of the everlasting union. Men, in most traditional jewish communities, do not wear a wedding ring. The fact that one is free to personalize the designs and make them look as unique as possible makes the tattoo option to be great. In order to move your ring as part of the wedding ceremony, you�ll probably need to get it sized by a jeweler.
