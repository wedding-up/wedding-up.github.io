<p>By helen pye 25 july 2020 12. Casual wedding reception only invite wording: Book a ceremony venue that�s nearby or at the same place as your reception and you�ll have more time for things like photos and mingling with your guests at cocktail hour. So on my final “wedding wednesday,” after showing you the first look and all the photoshoot fun, this is our amazing ceremony and reception. Thus, the cocktail hour was born.</p>

<p>Whether your heart is set on an indoor or outdoor wedding ceremony, the willows offers beautiful options. I think it is a fantastic idea. When designing your wedding ceremony, consider ways to personalize your decor, rituals, and ceremony messaging. Ceremony &amp; reception wedding terrace, poolside area, bridal suite rental fee: There was even room to build a large dance floor out of plywood, which also served as a platform for the wedding ceremony to get us up off the grass.</p>
