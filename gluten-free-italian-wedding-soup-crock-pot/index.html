With the chicken broth and beef/veal meatballs, i had thought i�d never be able to enjoy good italian wedding soup again as a vegan. Turn slow cooker to high. However you call it, you will love this keto meatball soup that is loaded with hearty vegetables. Let the pasta cook until tender, about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>My mom’s italian wedding soup was made with pastina (gluten), dairy, eggs, and meatballs (that contained gluten, dairy, and eggs). We had more soup left over after meatballs were all gone. Its like smelling grandmas italian wedding soup cook. My mom’s italian wedding soup was made with pastina (gluten), dairy, eggs, and meatballs (that contained gluten, dairy, and eggs). Fortunately, making delicious gluten free italian wedding soup from scratch isn’t all that difficult or time consuming.</p>

<p>The italian wedding soup served at italian restaurants is the american version of this traditional fare. I grew up with a sicilian mother (she passed in 2007) and wedding soup was a part of every holiday table growing up. Fortunately, making delicious gluten free italian wedding soup from scratch isn’t all that difficult or time consuming. My kids will eat anything that involves meatballs, i regularly make mexican meatball soup , slow cooker meatballs , and this super delicious italian wedding soup. Family favorite recipe is easy to make in the crockpot, delicious homemade meal.</p>
