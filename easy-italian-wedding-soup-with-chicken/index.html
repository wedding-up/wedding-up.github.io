Add the onion, carrots and celery and soften for about 5 minutes. I made one small variation from yours. In a large bowl add ground chicken, breadcrumbs, parmesan, thyme, salt, black pepper, egg, ground oregano, ground coriander and milk.</p>

<p>We love olive garden and this copy cat olive garden wedding soup recipe is amazing! This easy instant pot italian wedding soup is a hearty and comforting meal that comes together in a flash! If you are looking for a soup that is filling and delicious, you have to make this delicious slow cooker italian wedding soup. In a large bowl, combine the egg, bread crumbs, parsley, 1 tablespoon parmesan cheese, onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. I have no italian lineage and my mom never made it growing up, so for whatever reason it seemed easy to mess up.</p>

<p>Family favorite recipe is easy to make in the crockpot, delicious homemade meal. Italian wedding soup is a soup i really enjoy. I have always used only chicken broth, no beef broth. Add the stock and wine and bring to a boil. I’m not italian by heritage but i married into an italian family.</p>
