For the italian wedding soup: Place the ground meats, bread crumbs, parmesan, parsley, garlic, milk, egg, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl and combine gently with a fork. Brown the meatballs before adding to the soup to finish cooking.</p>

<p>When the onion starts to turn a golden color, add garlic, carrot and celery, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The beef broth definitely adds that extra punch this soup needs. Substitute spinach, chicory, chard or any other leafy green for the escarole or kale, and any leftover cooked (or canned) beans for the white beans in this healthy italian wedding soup recipe. In a bowl, combine the ground beef, first amounts of salt and pepper, the onion powder, parsley, egg, and parmesan cheese. Cook until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.</p>
