<p>This new version, with an adapted screenplay by bart freundlich, who also directed the film, stars mr. Secrets and sighs a vivid julianne moore fails to enliven this languid remake of susanne bier’s 2007 melodrama. Instead, the focus is on love and grief within a family. It’s intense — you break a sweat. After the wedding has a praiseworthy cast all performing at their peaks, but never quite gets to the emotional core.</p>

<p>This new version, with an adapted screenplay by bart freundlich, who also directed the film, stars mr. Freundlich�s wife, julianne moore, and michelle williams, billy crudup and abby after the wedding is a remake of the 2006 acclaimed danish film of the same name written by susanne bier. In “after the wedding,” a danish drama about ideals and money, sanctimony and obligation, bodies ricochet off one another like pinballs. The gender flip turns after the wedding into a decent feminist statement, albeit one without the edge of the original. The 2019 screenplay rewritten by bart freundlich is an emotional roller coaster with raw, naturalistic, complicated characters that are fascinating to watch.</p>
