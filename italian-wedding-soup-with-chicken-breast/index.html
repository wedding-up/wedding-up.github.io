<p>Remove chicken, cook and cut into small pieces. If you like italian wedding soup or chicken noodle soup then this pasta skillet featuring all the same flavors is going to knock your socks off. Feel free to add in any other veggies you have sitting in your fridge. 1 package (12 ounces) frozen fully cooked italian meatballs, thawed; In a medium bowl, beat the egg.</p>
