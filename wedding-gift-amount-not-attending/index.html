<p>Even if you can�t make it to the big day, a gift is still expected. This tip is pretty much wedding gift etiquette 101. Buy from the couple�s registry. The majority of soonlyweds want you to choose a gift from their already curated wedding registry. In 2019, wedding guests will spend about $55 to $110 per gift, experts say, but spending varies significantly, depending on a number of factors.</p>

<p>Even though many might consider it sacrilegious to not send a gift if not attending a wedding, under certain circumstances it is completely okay not to send one. Buy from the couple�s registry. Whether you go to the wedding has nothing to do with your gift. If you’re immediate family or a close friend, you should give a nice gift. Customarily in ireland, whether you give a physical present or a cash gift, the consensus is that you �cover the cost of your meal�, (typically about €75 to €120 per person).</p>

<p>If you’re attending multiple events that require a gift like the engagement party and the shower, budget accordingly and allot a certain amount of money to each gift so. I’d love to attend your wedding, but i can’t afford it your attendance is more important than what you give. Of course, if you�d like to give the couple a gift and are financially able to do so, you should. If you want to split your budget between both, then aim for 25% on the engagement present and 75% on the wedding gift. The easiest route would be just to send a gift from the couple’s registry, but if you’d prefer to send cash or a check, you can totally do so.</p>

<p>Whether you go to the wedding has nothing to do with your gift. The size of a gift might also vary if you’re attending with a guest rather than solo. The amount of money you will spend for a gift on a wedding at the park is the same amount you spend on a grand castle wedding. Additionally, you can go in on a registry gift with a group of people that would make your contribution less than $50 or buy you a little more time to pay the full amount. If you are not close with the wedding couple and are not attending, nothing more than a card stating your kind wishes and regret for being unable to appear is required.</p>
