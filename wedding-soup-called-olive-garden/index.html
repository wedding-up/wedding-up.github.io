<p>In large sauce pan, heat broth to boiling; Stir in the cheese, beef and pork. The soup is surely not only for weddings; If you haven’t tried italian wedding soup then you are missing out. Add mushrooms and thin strips of nori for more flavor.</p>

<p>Transfer meatballs to a plate lined with paper towels while leaving oil in skillet. In large sauce pan, heat broth to boiling; This is one of the most popular soup recipes! At just $11, olive garden ’s soup, salad, and breadsticks lunch combo is still one of. My dad says that is the american name.</p>

<p>My family has been making a version of this soup for years and was never called wedding soup. Can be made vegetarian by removing the meatballs and using vegetable stock. Over medium heat fill a large stockpot with the chicken stock. Add onions so they soften alongside of them if you like. The soup is surely not only for weddings;</p>
