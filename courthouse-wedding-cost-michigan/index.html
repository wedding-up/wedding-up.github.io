There is a required three (3) day waiting period to obtain the license after submission of an application. For my own courthouse wedding i had a dress made for me on etsy, and it cost about the same price as many of the bridesmaid dresses i wore. The costs usually start in the $50 to $100 range if you are willing to go to your local city hall or courthouse and have a justice there perform a brief ceremony. According to our research, the average courthouse wedding, just for the application alone, will cost anywhere from $30 to $150.</p>

<p>We will applied for our marriage license a week or so before that and it cost us $20.00. For guidance on additional methods of payment, please call ahead. You don’t want 200 eyes staring at you when you walk down the aisle, or say those vows, or dance. That is what it actually costs to get married. In the united states alone a regular wedding can cost up to $35 000, which is, to say, a lot.</p>
