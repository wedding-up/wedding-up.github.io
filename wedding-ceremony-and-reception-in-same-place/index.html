<p>Wedding ceremony and reception at the same place? This is a good job for groomsmen and ushers. If the reception is at the same place as the ceremony, make sure you have other people on hand to show guests precisely where the reception space is. Also, you may be able to negotiate a cheaper price for using more than one service provided at a particular location. It seems silly to include a separate reception card with the same location, but i have no idea how to fit it all on the wedding invitation.</p>

<p>Last dance or a “wedding farewell” as the bride and groom enter a car in front of the grand and are whisked away on their honeymoon. It�s a big room with lots of windows and natural light. If the ceremony and reception are held at the same venue, include the line “reception to follow” at the bottom of the invitation. Hosts provide their choice of food and drink, although a wedding cake is popular. We did not have it at the same place but the ceremony and reception were within walking distance in the same area.</p>

<p>The couple receive society, in the form of family and friends, for the first time as a married couple. There is no gap between the ceremony and the reception. Note that this wedding timeline also assumes the ceremony and reception are being held at the same venue, which means guests won�t need to travel to a separate party location before cocktail hour. Since the venue doesn�t provide anyone to move around tables and chairs (like during cocktail hour), we are going to have tables set up so guests will be seated there for both the ceremony and reception. I think it’s convenient to have them in the same place, or at least very close together, because people don’t waste time to travel from one place to another.</p>

<p>Depending on the logistics of your wedding reception, cocktail hour typically begins immediately following the ceremony (if the ceremony and reception are held at the same venue), or about 30 minutes later (if there’s travel involved). Note that this wedding timeline also assumes the ceremony and reception are being held at the same venue, which means guests won�t need to travel to a separate party location before cocktail hour. Hosts provide their choice of food and drink, although a wedding cake is popular. Couples planning their wedding usually begin with the perfect wedding venue. Cocktail hour is the kickoff to the reception and should last at least an hour.</p>

<p>Wendy from cary asks, can we have the ceremony in the same place as the reception? There will be tables set on either side of a dance floor which will double as an aisle. That is just how we want things! The couple receive society, in the form of family and friends, for the first time as a married couple. I think it’s convenient to have them in the same place, or at least very close together, because people don’t waste time to travel from one place to another.</p>

<p>Any additional time needed for a ceremony would be at an additional cost. If you do the ceremony at the same place as the reception, usually the guests don�t have anywhere to go (if you guys are out doing photos) and the venue might need tables moved and things set up and usually the guests will want appetizers or something to munch on. Cut out the travel (and limo fees) between the chapel and reception hall by having the wedding on the same location as your reception! Change the date to a weekday, or sunday. Couples planning their wedding usually begin with the perfect wedding venue.</p>

<p>If the reception is at the same place as the ceremony, make sure you have other people on hand to show guests precisely where the reception space is. For this reason, providing them with a wedding reception timeline is a must. We created a photo scavenger hunt for our guests for after the ceremony/before the cocktail so that they could walk around and explore everything. You are likely to have more people attend your ceremony. The couple receive society, in the form of family and friends, for the first time as a married couple.</p>

<p>Have your ceremony and reception in the same location. I usually like this setup better as a guest because i do not have to navigate driving directions or transport (especially if the city is unfamiliar) to get from point a to point b, and there is usually more time. There is no gap between the ceremony and the reception. I think it’s convenient to have them in the same place, or at least very close together, because people don’t waste time to travel from one place to another. Since the venue doesn�t provide anyone to move around tables and chairs (like during cocktail hour), we are going to have tables set up so guests will be seated there for both the ceremony and reception.</p>
