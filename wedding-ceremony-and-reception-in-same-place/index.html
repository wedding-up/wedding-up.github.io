<p>Last dance or a “wedding farewell” as the bride and groom enter a car in front of the grand and are whisked away on their honeymoon. Cut out the travel (and limo fees) between the chapel and reception hall by having the wedding on the same location as your reception! Hosts provide their choice of food and drink, although a wedding cake is popular. If you do the ceremony at the same place as the reception, usually the guests don�t have anywhere to go (if you guys are out doing photos) and the venue might need tables moved and things set up and usually the guests will want appetizers or something to munch on. I think it’s convenient to have them in the same place, or at least very close together, because people don’t waste time to travel from one place to another.</p>

<p>We are having a dw and both the ceremony and reception are in the same room. *please note that mchale’s wedding package is a standard 5 hour event; We�re getting married beneath the apple trees and the reception hall is like 50ft away maybe. But if this isn�t your particular scenario, read on for some pointers on long breaks and guest comfort. We’ve included a five hour reception timeline and answered 7 common reception and party questions to keep your unforgettable night running smoothly.</p>

<p>Our ceremony and reception are in the same place. Have the ceremony and reception indoors. With a ceremony and reception in the same place, you can also have a later ceremony because you may not need as much time between the two. It seems silly to include a separate reception card with the same location, but i have no idea how to fit it all on the wedding invitation. The couple receive society, in the form of family and friends, for the first time as a married couple.</p>

<p>Since the venue doesn�t provide anyone to move around tables and chairs (like during cocktail hour), we are going to have tables set up so guests will be seated there for both the ceremony and reception. Usually the wedding planner, mc or venue manager is in charge of keeping things in order. A wedding reception is a party usually held after the completion of a marriage ceremony as hospitality for those who have attended the wedding, hence the name reception: The transitions are usually smooth, as the ceremony and reception aren�t held in the same room or the same part of the reception site. Typically the bride�s father welcomes everyone to the wedding reception and thanks them for coming.</p>

<p>Some of our brides want to have the ceremony and reception in different locations because they may have a meaningful attachment to a certain place for the ceremony, but the ceremony site may not. If your ceremony and reception are at separate locations, don�t forget about timing transportation between them either. If the reception is at the same place as the ceremony, make sure you have other people on hand to show guests precisely where the reception space is. The pros of having both your ceremony and reception in the same location. If you�re concerned about the guests getting tired, make it a quick ceremony and be sure to have 10+ seats in the reception.</p>
