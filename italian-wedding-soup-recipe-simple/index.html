<p>When it comes to comfort food, this recipe is a real winner! Add in bread crumbs, parsley, oregano, parmesan, egg, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Normally we go for a hearty minestrone or loaded potato soup, but lately i’ve been getting requests for a classic italian wedding soup, mainly from my husband. Crumble beef and sausage over mixture and mix lightly but thoroughly. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well.</p>
