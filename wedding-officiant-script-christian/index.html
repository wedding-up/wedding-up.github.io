<p>When creating a wedding ceremony that reflects your personalities and relationship, selecting the right readings can make your ceremony truly magical. I had a recent wedding where the couple smacked each other’s posteriors after kissing. Opening it is with joy and happiness that we gather on this occasion to celebrate the union of jordan swartz and michelle harris in the holy bond of marriage. We are gathered here today in the sight of god, and the presence of friends and loved ones, to celebrate one of life�s greatest moments. Just download and insert the names of the couple, or edit and personalize it as you see fit.</p>
