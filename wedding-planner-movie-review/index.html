<p>Dipping back into last year’s holiday offerings, when everything else was overshadowed by the spectacular hot mess that was a christmas prince, my netflix scrolling led me to christmas wedding planner. Jennifer lopez plays san francisco�s most successful supplier of romance and glamour. The wedding plan critics consensus. At least, until a handsome pediatrician comes to her aid after nearly being run over by a runaway trashcan. The wedding planner is a perfect example of what happens when the appeal of the two leads cannot overcome the obstacle presented by an irredeemably stupid screenplay.</p>

<p>The wedding planner is a 2001 american romantic comedy film directed by adam shankman, written by michael ellis and pamela falk, and starring jennifer lopez and matthew mcconaughey. She knows all the rules. The wedding planner is a breezy, relatively tame romantic comedy with a unique clash of characters. This is not exactly a ringing endorsement, i realize.

<p>The directorial debut of former choreographer adam shankman, the wedding planner costars kevin pollak, judy greer, and kathy najimy. Now she’s got her eye on the wedding of fran donolly, a wealthy internet entrepreneur whose daddy will spare no expense to. There’s just one small problem. Finally a good movie without the harsh language and sex scenes and gay characters. The emotions work well but the film takes its own time to register as it is based on urban relationships and bonding.</p>

<p>Lopez and the quadrangle between mary, steve, fran, and the italian suitor develops into an interesting, entertaining series of problems that, regrettably, are resolved in a rather pedestrian by the movie’s abrupt ending. Whenever anyone needs to arrange a lavish wedding, they come to her. She’s got a purse full of everything from bobby pins to bottled water. She knows all the rules. Truly a movie you can feel comfortable watching with your friends.</p>

<p>Bt when mary falls (literally) for a handsome doctor her busy. Write a review of your wedding venue, photographer, florist and more to help other brides plan their weddings. The film tells the story of the most successful supplier of romance and glamour. If you’re at the multiplex in the middle of the afternoon, and the wedding ringer is the only movie playing at a time that’s convenient, you won’t be completely miserable. This is not exactly a ringing endorsement, i realize.</p>
