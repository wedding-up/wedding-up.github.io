After officiating my first wedding and taking the time to pull together the wedding ceremony script i thought it would be good to post what i came up with for others to use. Whoever said a wedding has to be 100% serious?</p>

<p>I wrote this ceremony script with the help of offbeat bride, and i am really happy with the results. For many couples, writing your own wedding vows is a surefire way to get your personality—and your sense of humor—to come through. Simply download it and print it out, or add extra details as needed. Closing my eyes, it still feels like yesterday instead of half a year ago.… Jon, please repeat after me:</p>

<p>The wedding officiant often reads from a helpful script to make sure that the ceremony stays on track. Fun non religious wedding ceremony script with reference to children. You could make the vows or ring exchange wording funny. All the legal elements are present in this funny wedding script, but laughter is encouraged along the way. All of the above wedding ceremonies have been tried and tested in the real world at some of the most beautiful weddings ever witnessed.</p>
