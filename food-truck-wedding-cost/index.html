<p>Stef atkinson • see full wedding here. Using a food truck instead of a more traditional catering option slashes the per guest cost at least in half, if not more. If you choose a food truck instead, you’ll only end up paying $25 to $35 a guest. If you are willing to spend $100,000 or more, you can get extra bells and whistles, or an entirely new truck.
