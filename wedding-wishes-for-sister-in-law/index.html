Sweet wedding wishes for sister posted on july 11, 2017 september 13, 2020 by admin she was once that naggy, small/ big, snitchy sister whom you love and treat like your best friend, now, she is a beautiful bride ready to walk down that aisle and say i do to her prince charming, the guy whom she used to sneak out just to go see. The feeling of being loved by a family that one wasn’t originally born into sends such thrill down one’s heart and entire body.</p>

<p>And when you�re the mother or father of the bride or groom, you�ll most likely feel a flurry of emotions that are extra tricky to get down on paper. I wish both of you all the best. My deepest wish is that may god showers his blessing upon you both. I couldn’t be happier for you both. There is nothing beautiful as the two of you together.</p>
