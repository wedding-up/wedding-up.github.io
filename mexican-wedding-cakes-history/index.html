<p>Mexican wedding cookies we thought it was about time we shared the recipe to one of our traditional christmas cookie recipes, mexican wedding cookies (or snowballs!). Mexicans have been enjoying this treat since the 1500s! Review this recipe add photo. Eventually, the cookie spread to spain, and from there to the rest of the world. The wedding lazo, also known as lasso, is part of all mexican weddings.</p>

<p>I always find it interesting to study the history behind the names of foods, and in this case, the names of cookies. Curious about why are they called mexican wedding cakes? Suprisingly enough, mexican wedding cookies did not come from mexico. These sweet confections actually were created by the arabs in medieval times. A wedding cake is an essential element to celebrate and share your joy with others.</p>
