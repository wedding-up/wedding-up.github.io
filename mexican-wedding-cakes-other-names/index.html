<p>Tres leches cakes are popular at celebrations and parties, or even at weddings as well as the mexican wedding cake. I’ve always known them as mexican wedding cookies, but they also go by the name of snowball cookies, pecan sandies, russian tea cakes, italian wedding cookies, and polvorones. These cookies were popular back in the day (the day being, for us boomers, the ’50s and ’60s). I’ve heard people call them: I’ve never known of any other cookie to take on so many names (mexican wedding cakes, russian tea cakes, snowball cookies, swedish teacakes, danish almond cookies, and more)!</p>

<p>They go by many different names (russian or swedish tea cakes, snowball cookies, pecan meltaways, etc), but since my family is mexican, we stick with mexican wedding cakes. The term mexican wedding cookie/cake appeared in the american vocabulary in the 1950s during the time of the cold war when relationships between russia and america was strained. The mexican wedding cake recipe also known as a russian tea cakes are actually cookies. I’ve always known them as mexican wedding cookies, but they also go by the name of snowball cookies, pecan sandies, russian tea cakes, italian wedding cookies, and polvorones. Many historians believe the term mexican wedding cake/cookie was used to replace the name russian teacakes in every cookbook.</p>

<p>I feel like they are a tradition for so many families, and every country seems to claim them. These cookies were popular back in the day (the day being, for us boomers, the ’50s and ’60s). Regardless of what they are called, they always contain finely chopped nuts and are twice rolled in powdered sugar. For some reason these cookies go by a number of different names. Mexican wedding cookies are buttery shortbread cookies filled with pecans and rolled in powdered sugar.</p>
