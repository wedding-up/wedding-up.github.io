<p>Patih jelantik, kuta, bali, 80361, indonesia wedding location: First legal wedding with wedding certificate, second wedding ceremonial only [for ceremonial wedding normally organize by wedding organizer, most case the client have done the legal wedding in their country, and normally the clients want the ceremony performs in balinese style or western style. From the first time we met them, we knew that we can work together very well with them. Bali is one of my favorite places in the world so when margot reached out to me about turning her 30th birthday trip into a secret elopement, i was beyond excited. Sawangan beach is a perfect example of this, a public beach located in front of the hilton bali resort, and the best part is that it’s almost empty (that is if you can keep the secret)!</p>
