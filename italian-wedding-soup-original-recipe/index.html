File this under my new fav recipe: It did not say where to add the salt so i went back to this site and there is a different wedding soup recipe which calls for baking the meatballs before adding. Mix together 1 egg and 1/4 cup romano cheese add this mixture slowly to soup while whisking soup.</p>

<p>I first had italian wedding soup years ago and had the desire to make my own batch recently. Unfortunately italian wedding soup has nothing to do with weddings. This recipe originally appeared on the rachael ray show. Italian wedding soup with the best chicken meatballs and parmesan broth! For more recipes and videos from the show visit rachaelrayshow.com.</p>

<p>Italian wedding soup is a healthy and delicious easy to make homemade soup filled with flavorful small bite sized sausage meatballs and tender green vegetables. I have no italian lineage and my mom never made it growing up, so for whatever reason it seemed easy to mess up. Protein, vitamins, fiber, and tons of flavor. Stir in the cheese, beef and pork. Make a big batch to enjoy throughout the week!</p>
