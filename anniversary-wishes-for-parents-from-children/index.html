<p>Happy anniversary is the day that celebrate years of togetherness and love. Your mother and father merit the most delightful greetings for the diligent work and commitment to their family. My friends feel jealous because i got the most amazing and coolest parents. Anniversary wishes for parents from children. 2) you are the parents that all kids hope to have, you are the couple that all lovers hope to be and you both are the pillars of support that every family wishes it had.</p>
