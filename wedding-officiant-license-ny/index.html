<p>Regardless of where the marriage license is being issued in the state, if the wedding ceremony itself is taking place anywhere in new york city (not just manhattan, not just brooklyn) then, as the officiant, you must register with the marriage bureau at 141 worth street in manhattan. As the officiant, your signature on the marriage license means that you are saying these two individuals are legally allowed to get married. Governor cuomo�s executive order allowing online wedding ceremonies (executive order 202.20) has been extended six times (executive orders 202.33, 202.39, 202.49, 202.55, 202.60, 202.67). The couple or the officiant must print the signed document and send it back to city hall within 5 business days of the wedding ceremony. We recommend booking your wedding officiant at least eight months before.</p>
