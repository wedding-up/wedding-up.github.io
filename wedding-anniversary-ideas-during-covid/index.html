<p>A 50th anniversary party was almost better in quarantine than in person. Rather than letting the pandemic spoil their celebrations, many have come together (while keeping a safe social distance) to surprise one another on special occasions. Are about to celebrate another 12 months together. Silver is given on the 25th anniversary, while gold is given on the 50th anniversary. Time flies when you’re having fun, so it�s no surprise that you and your s.o.</p>
