No matter where you are in the world, a wedding is by far the most significant symbol of lifelong personal commitment between two individuals. In december, my niece carrmen married her longtime boyfriend at a courthouse in washington, d.c.</p>

<p>Justice of the peace weddings are sometimes referred to as civil wedding ceremonies because they are not conducted in a church, synagogue or other religious venue. Others are able to be very accommodating about the time and place where weddings may occur. Couples that want to get a courthouse wedding are becoming more and more increasing in their numbers. Here is a look at some of the best courthouse wedding vows. You are just as married whether it takes places in a courthouse or in a 200 year old catholic church.</p>

<p>Others are able to be very accommodating about the time and place where weddings may occur. A courthouse wedding ceremony is a civil ceremony during which a couple makes vows to each other and the officiant pronounces them married. I didn�t do this but it�s my understanding from other couples� experiences that yes, you can say your own vows at a courthouse wedding. A vow renewal is an opportunity for a couple to renew the vows that they made to each other when they first got married. You can have hundreds of reasons to be getting married at the courthouse, some of which we will be discussing in this article.</p>

<p>Most officials performing the wedding will have a prearranged set of vows, but the only legal requirement is for the couple getting married to solemnly state in front of an official and the two witnesses that they take each other as husband and wife. I loved the experience of getting married at the courthouse and my husband and i had a really lovely day, i just wish i had proper photos to remember it by. The idea behind the exchange of vows in the traditional christian ceremony is to essentially make a contract between the husband and wife to perform certain obligations. In the traditional christian ceremony, the marriage vows are not really vowed at all but covenants. Angela, i definitely wish i would have done that when i got married!</p>
