<p>Big, big plans, chris lane Upbeat tunes are great for getting the party started, but we can�t deny that wedding slow dance songs are just as important when it comes to having an unforgettable wedding playlist.from your first dance as newlyweds to the parent dances, there are a few major moments at the reception when a slower song is more fitting.

And while there are some classic tunes that will bring everyone to their feet, it’s a good idea to mix the oldies with some new 2020 wedding songs to please guests of all ages. Songs that guests of all ages will love from dj dos as much as i love hearing (and playing) the hottest tracks of today, there’s a timeless element to the classic songs that came out in the 1950s &amp; ’60s that a lot of modern music lacks.</p>
