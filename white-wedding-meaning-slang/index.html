<p>The term “white sale” means a store sale of sheets, towels, other linens. A very very long sentence. [ edit ] i�ve heard once white wedding is a slang for someone going cocaine again after having stopped it for some time. Tradition and trends say that the dress is usually white, though alternative brides often opt for blush or any other colour of their choosing. If you are a millenial (born between 1980 and 2000), or a generation z (born after 2000), you would agree that trending slang come up faster than you can retain.</p>
