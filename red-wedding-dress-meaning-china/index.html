<p>As china is a very traditional oriental nation, it attaches much importance on etiquettes. Red lanterns adorn businesses and residences. Double rows of red xi (happiness) letters are pasted on gates and doors. In modern weddings, the bride generally picks red (following chinese tradition) or white (more western) for the wedding, but most will wear the red traditional garment for their formal wedding banquet. People wear red during weddings, festivals and other celebratory events.</p>
