Having a courthouse wedding means you may only need one witness at hand, and you can still invite your closest family and friends to attend (just make sure to check the witness requirements and guest allowance, which vary by state). This will give you images that you can look back on and cherish for the rest of your life. For my own courthouse wedding i had a dress made for me on etsy, and it cost about the same price as many of the bridesmaid dresses i wore before that. Your parents must appear with identification and if a custodial parent, proof of their custody.</p>
