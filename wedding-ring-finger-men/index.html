<p>Because of that, it was the natural finger to wear a wedding ring on. There are no hard rules on matching metals when it comes to rings, as the most common ring (wedding) is fixed. (apparently they never heard the story about the vein running from the finger to the heart!) It is usually forged from metal, and traditionally is forged of gold or another precious metal. The engagement ring symbolises a promise of marriage and your wedding band solidifies this promise.</p>

We can engrave on the inside or outside of most rings. Men, in most traditional jewish communities, do not wear a wedding ring.</p>
