<p>The officiant will say a few things about marriage before you exchange rings or its alternative, using similar words. I would imagine your officiant has a template and will write a script for you.

Whether you’re officiating for a relative or acquaintance, you want to make sure the ceremony is memorable for everyone, especially the couple. Find out the role of your officiant after the wedding particularly concerning the signed marriage license.</p>
