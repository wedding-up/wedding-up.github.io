We�ve all seen the glory that is the awkward family photos site, so we�re familiar with how good pictures can go seriously wrong in spite of (or because of?) the amount of time and effort we put into creating them. Grandma doesn’t need to stand to get down. When cake cuttings go wrong photographer tom hall had the misfortune of documenting this incident at a couple’s wedding.</p>

<p>When you hire a professional wedding photographer, you’re hiring more than someone with a good camera and a photographic eye. And we all out of cats. Couples often shell out lots of money to get the perfect photographer and venue, and people generally take the whole formal portrait thing pretty seriously. When wedding photos go wrong: You cherish them for the rest of your life.</p>
