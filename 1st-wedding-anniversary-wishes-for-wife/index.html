<p>After 365 days, i still can’t get enough of you. A wedding anniversary is a lovely acknowledgment or milestone of the day you get married. I am so madly, deeply, crazily in love with you my bride. When we are together, we drown out the crowd just to fell the love in each other. Marrying you was the best thing i’ve ever done in my life.</p>
