<p>What to write in a wedding card by keely chace on february 18, 2020 imagine yourself in the parking lot walking in to your friend’s wedding reception—pen in hand, necktie/pantyhose in a twist, desperately trying to think up a warm and meaningful personal message to write in your wedding card for the happy couple. Date night ideas while staying safe from the corona virus. Delhi revises limit on wedding guests from 200 to 50 amid rise in cases.

What i’ve noticed, and what we are doing, is reassuring our couples that we are taking extra precautions with cleaning the space. Your wedding day will come and go, but may your love forever grow. I’m supposed to stay with my grandparents for christmas the week after the wedding. Remember lockdown, social distancing, toilet paper and hand sanitizer shortages, masks, quarntine.</p>
