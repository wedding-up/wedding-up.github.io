<p>To repair damaged system, you have to purchase the licensed version of reimage reimage. My reasoning for only giving the app 4 stars instead of 5, is that there is an inspiration board you can create but it is not working properly. Yalp store | download play store apps. It will not allow me to add inspiration pictures nor link my pinterest. I have emailed as well as called, but because this website is free, there is only so much customer service we have access to.</p>

To fix drag and drop on windows, try to restart file explorer process. I have emailed as well as called, but because this website is free, there is only so much customer service we have access to.</p>
