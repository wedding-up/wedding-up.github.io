<p>What to wear to an indian wedding. Female guests must wear at least a couple of bangles on each hand and male guests can add jewelled buttons to add a touch of bling. One of the first things that might surprise western guests is the baraat, or groom�s procession.for this, the groom arrives to the ceremony on a decorated white horse. It all depends on your choice. Guests dance around him to the beat of a dhol, an indian drum.after that, the bride and her family greet the groom, and the couple exchanges floral garlands to wear.</p>
