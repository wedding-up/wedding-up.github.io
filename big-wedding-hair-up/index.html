<p>Once you achieve the hair of your dreams, select your favorite to don on the big day. Lengthy locks are incredibly versatile—and we’ve rounded up over 30 wedding looks to prove it! The way the hair has been wrapped up high in a large and voluminous style would go perfectly with an overall grecian themed wedding, while the strands of hair coming from the front and going below the main part of the updo make this one of my favorite subtle touches in any of these wedding updos. With long hair, your wedding updo options are pretty much endless. Big island beauty &amp; bridal is a professional wedding hair and makeup service based in kailua kona, hawaii.</p>

<p>To create the big effect, take the tail of a comb, insert into the bun and push the interior of the bun outward. She was well organised and a much needed calming influence! And it can work with or without a veil. Once you’re done, braid the remaining section fishtail.

It�s a big question, my friends. All you need to do is scroll, save your faves and show them to your hairstylist at your wedding hair trial. Others swept their hair up in chic and clean chignons for a totally timeless formal vibe.</p>
