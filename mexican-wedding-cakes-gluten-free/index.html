<p>We typically make gluten free snowball cookies for christmas day and we often make extra to share with friends, as a holiday gift. Best wedding cake frosting weddin cakes for you. I like a pecan nuts in this recipe. They’re also known as mexican wedding cookies, russian tea cakes, and italian wedding cookies. The history of mexican wedding cakes is largely unknown.</p>

<p>Snowball cookies are a classic nutty, buttery, sweet holiday dessert with many forms: Mexican wedding cakes are traditionally a wheat cookie, with either pecans (the mexican version) or almonds (the russian version) thrown into the mix. Add the flour, walnuts and salt. Granulated sugar, cream of tartar, egg whites, unsalted butter and 3 more. Some believe the recipe originated in eastern europe.</p>
