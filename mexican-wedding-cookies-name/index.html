<p>Soft, buttery pecan mexican wedding cookies are a traditional cookie recipe idea for the holidays or for special occasions. And oh, what a cookie. Mexican wedding cookies or snowball cookies or sweethearts, whatever you want to call them, they are all the same basic recipe: Can mexican wedding cookies be frozen? Mexican wedding cookies are easy to make and require only few ingredients.</p>

<p>Butter, sugar, vanilla, flour, nuts, and a healthy dusting of powdered sugar. Key ingredients in mexican wedding cakes are pretty basic. They�re very popular and can be found in most bakeries. Basically butter and (usually) finely chopped nuts held together by flour and sugar, they begin to shatter and disintegrate the moment they hit. You might know mexican wedding cookies as russian tea cakes, snowball cookies or mexican wedding cakes.</p>

<p>Commonly known as russian tea cakes they are also referred to as mexican wedding cookies. (mexican pulverizers?!) technically you have quite a bit of leeway on the nuts used in this recipe, but after recently trying a pecans and almonds mix we are back to using 100 percent pecans as they just. However, the recipes are all very similar to each other. They also make a wonderful addition to any christmas goodie platter. Christmas is a good time for you and your family to make happy memories together.</p>
