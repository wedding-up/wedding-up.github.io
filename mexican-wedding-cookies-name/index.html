You might know mexican wedding cookies as russian tea cakes, snowball cookies or mexican wedding cakes. Plus, i have a simple trick to get a nice, thick coating of confectioner’s sugar on the cookies that won’t easily shake off.</p>

<p>I’ve always known them as mexican wedding cookies, but they also go by the name of snowball cookies, pecan sandies, russian tea cakes, italian wedding cookies, and polvorones. (i can see why the name snowball cookies got started!) Whatever you call these, they are melt in your mouth delicious! You may also know these cookie treats as snowballs, polvorones, butterballs, pecan sandies, russuan tea cakes, sandies and many more names. Mexican wedding cookies are easy to make and require only few ingredients.</p>

<p>However, the recipes are all very similar to each other. Key ingredients in mexican wedding cakes are pretty basic. I was born and raised in mexico city. Sometimes you’ll see these referred to polvorones, a term used liberally to describe a wide range of cookies that all fall in the crumbly shortbread realm. No matter what they’re called, they’re all simply delicious.</p>

<p>Basically butter and (usually) finely chopped nuts held together by flour and sugar, they begin to shatter and disintegrate the moment they hit. Whether you call them mexican wedding cookies, russian tea cakes or snowball cookies, these delicate buttery cookies, rolled in powdered sugar (with many different names) are a staple each year at christmas. Some believe the recipe originated in eastern europe. In fact, “mexican wedding cookie” wasn’t considered a “thing” until the 1950’s. I lived there all my life until i married my husband, another mexican, and moved to the u.s.</p>
