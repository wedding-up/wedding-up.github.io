<p>Not all cultures believe that the wedding ring should be placed on the left hand. But if it�s still worn, it can be both on the left ring finger (iran) and on the right (jordan). A band on the right fourth finger indicates engagement, while a band on the left fourth finger indicates marriage. Some prefer wearing their engagement ring on their left ring finger and their wedding band on their right ring finger. However, in nations around the world, wedding rings are worn on the right ring finger.</p>

<p>A band on the right fourth finger indicates engagement, while a band on the left fourth finger indicates marriage. Western customs for wedding rings can be traced to ancient rome, egypt, and greece, and were transmitted to the present through christendom in europe, which adapted the pagan customs. A bride and groom typically exchange rings during their wedding ceremony, placing the ring on each other�s wedding ring finger—the fourth finger of the left hand—after saying their vows. In many countries, the ring finger of the right hand is where the wedding ring goes for both men and women.
