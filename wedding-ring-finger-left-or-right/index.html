<p>In western cultures, it is common for people to wear engagement and wedding rings on the fourth digit, often on the left hand. It also may feel more comfortable than wearing it on your dominant hand. After which, they can choose to leave the engagement ring on their right hand, or move it on top of the band. In the west, the left hand is the standard choice for wedding rings and engagement rings to be worn on, whereas in the east, many cultures prefer wearing their engagement ring on the right hand, as well as their wedding ring on the right hand. This tradition is commonly followed in russia, india, many scandinavian countries, as well as some east european and south american countries.</p>

<p>Opt for a ring on each hand: Some prefer wearing their engagement ring on their left ring finger and their wedding band on their right ring finger. In many northern and eastern european countries, including denmark, norway, russia, poland, and bulgaria, it is more common to wear the wedding ring on the fourth finger of the right hand. The index finger on the right hand is seen as the wedding ring finger in traditional jewish marriages. The more ‘practical myth’ behind wearing the wedding ring on the fourth finger of the left hand is that since most individuals are right handed, this means that the left hand is not used as much;</p>
