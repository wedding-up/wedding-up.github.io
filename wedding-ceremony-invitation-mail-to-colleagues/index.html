The wedding ceremony shall start at 9, following the arrival of the baraat. 1 bride (name) &amp; groom( name) are getting hitched and you’r attendance is mandatory. As a person�s wedding day nears by, the most important thing on his task list will be to distribute wedding invitation cards.</p>

<p>I will send you the formal wedding card with all the details of the venue attached. It could be printed on paper or sent via email. When planning a wedding, brides are faced with the often dreaded chore of deciding who to invite to their special day. A wedding is an exceptional occasion for the couple, and that is why they want to share this moment with their close ones. Your wedding invitation wording should be unique and elegant.</p>

<p>Your job is to come up with wording that makes you and your partner happy and causes minimal. Avoid accepting offers of help from people you didn’t invite. I believe your colleagues expect to receive only official announcement and not invitation I warmly welcome you and your family to this ceremony. If the invitees start chatting about the invitations or wedding at work, just find a quiet time to take them aside and talk privately.</p>
