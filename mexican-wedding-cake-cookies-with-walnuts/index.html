<p>They are little butter and nut balls rolled in powdered sugar and can be piled high on a pastry table for your guests to enjoy. Combine butter and granulated sugar in bowl for electric mixer. Add to the medium bowl containing finely ground walnuts. Some recipes have a crazy refrigeration time of 4 hours or even overnight, but honestly an hour is all you need to get this dough solid so that it stays in the ball shape while baking up. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p>

<p>It really is an easy recipe to follow. These easy mexican wedding cookies have walnuts in the dough and are rolled in powdered sugar so they look exactly like snowballs! They go by many different names (russian or swedish tea cakes, snowball cookies, pecan meltaways, etc), but since my family is mexican, we stick with mexican wedding cakes. Soft, buttery pecan mexican wedding cookies are a traditional cookie recipe idea for the holidays or for special occasions. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until light and fluffy.</p>
