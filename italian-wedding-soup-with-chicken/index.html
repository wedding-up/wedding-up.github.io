This wedding soup recipe is the very first one that i ever posted here on my little corner of the internet. I always bought it canned and it was just too salty. Escarole soup) is made by stewing a whole chicken to make homemade chicken broth then adding escarole, celery, onions, and carrots, mini meatballs and chicken bits.</p>

<p>Season with salt and pepper. I’m not italian by heritage but i married into an italian family. In the background we have ground chicken. You can make this soup, with other types of meats for the meatballs, but i have to say that for this italian wedding soup, i prefer chicken meatballs. The weather has turned, the boots, gloves and jackets are strewn throughout the house, and soup has become a regular offering on our dinner menu.</p>

<p>Family raved, best italian wedding soup ever. I added a can of white. Pour in chicken broth, season soup with salt and pepper to taste and bring mixture to a boil. I have always used only chicken broth, no beef broth. Whisk in chicken stock and bay leaves;</p>
