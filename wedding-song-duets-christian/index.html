<p>Metal/rock gets you focused and pumped up! Once wedding season comes around, some love songs become less classic and more predictable. This song is a great choice for the wedding procession because it combines the idea of marriage with praise and worship. The emotional denouement to 1988’s rattle &amp; hum and a song whose lyric (“all the promises we make, from the cradle to the grave”) seems especially resonant on any wedding day. A great presentation of love through song is as a duet.</p>
