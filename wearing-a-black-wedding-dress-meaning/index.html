This dream could signify an upcoming marriage you will attend or in some cases that could be your wedding. Joys and sorrows will quickly alternate, not allowing you a break. From a symbolic dream dictionary sense, this indicates that you will hold magical gifts in life.

<p>Once a taboo colour for anyone, let alone the bride, to wear to a wedding, black gowns are making an impact. * the wearer likes black * the wearer looks good in black * the wearer lives in a place (e.g., new york city) where black is practically a uniform * the wearer works in a place where black clothing is required; Imo, charcoal would be better than black if she loves the dress and is worried about wearing black.
