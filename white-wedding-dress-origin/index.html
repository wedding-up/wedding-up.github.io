<p>The white wedding dress is not, as believed, the symbol of purity. Queen victoria’s choice to wear white in her 1840 wedding set a trend and soon it became standard for brides to wear white. A few made brave efforts with parachute silk, whilst others wore gowns borrowed from relatives, but most brides wore uniform. Queen victoria is credited with starting the western world�s white wedding dress trend in 1840—before then, brides simply wore their best dress. In the modern, western world, we generally consider white dresses to be signs of purity or virginity, since mainstream christian values hold that it is ideal to be a virgin on your wedding day, and there are longstanding traditions and cultural associations between whiteness and purity.</p>

<p>Photos of that dress were seen all over the world. The white dress has become as much a symbol of a christian wedding as wedding bands and diamond engagement rings, if not more. She was also the first royal bride to have bridesmaids carry. Within the modern �white wedding� tradition, a white dress and veil are unusual choices for a woman�s second or subsequent wedding. Before then, colored dresses were the norm for brides of all classes.</p>

<p>Queen victoria’s choice to wear white in her 1840 wedding set a trend and soon it became standard for brides to wear white. White is often associated with purity, which is why it�s thought of as the traditional color for virgin brides. Some attribute its origin to britain�s queen victoria, who married prince albert in 1840 and wore a honiton lace white dress. The dress sure was the barbie princess. Within the modern �white wedding� tradition, a white dress and veil are unusual choices for a woman�s second or subsequent wedding.</p>

<p>One possibility is the roman belief in the vena amoris, which was believed to be. In looking at white wedding dress history, you might be surprised to learn that white has not always been the color of choice for wedding dresses in western culture, nor is it necessarily the symbol of purity commonly thought. The history of white wedding dresses tends to get a little confusing. Matching bridesmaids are good luck. Although white and cream were worn for weddings in the 18th century, it was in the following century that white became the colour to which brides aspired.</p>
