The color of this stone can range from the palest of blue to a deep ocean blue, which is called maxixe. While the 19th year of marriage does not have a well known theme like some other years, there are still traditions linked with this anniversary. Aquamarine is a variety of beryl that is blue or cyan in color. Traditionally you celebrate with fruit and flowers and on the modern list with linen which makes great gifts for him and her.</p>
