<p>Add stick of cinnamon to sugar while in blender. Stir in the eggs one at a time. ~ for mexican wedding cookies, do not add the cinnamon, anise or pecans. Add anise seeds to the lard and beat at medium speed with an electric mixer. Cut out cookies (i used a 2 1/2 inch circle cutter and a 2 1/2 inch star cutter).</p>

<p>Mix in a little more extra flour, so the dough is not too sticky. Transfer the baking sheets to wire racks and let cool for 5 minutes, then remove the cookies one at a time and roll them in the confectioners� sugar. These cookies were simple to make and would be simple enough for a child to make (w/ adult supervision). Thanks to the foodie monday bloghop theme of mexican recipes my house was smelling divine as these anise and cinnamon infused, melt in the mouth, buttery mexican wedding cookies were being baked in my kitchen. In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar at medium speed until creamy.</p>
