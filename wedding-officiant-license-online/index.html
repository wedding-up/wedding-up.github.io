<p>Amm doesn’t just ordain you. There are 95 counties in virginia and some county clerks will happily process your application to officiate weddings. Get ordained today as a minister to perform marriage ceremonies for friends and family. Per nevada revised statutes (nrs) 122.200, “any person who shall make a false statement in procuring a marriage license with reference to any matter required by nrs 122.040 and 122.050 to be stated under oath shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.” You will bring this license to your wedding, we will all sign it together, and then deanna of kona wedding officiant will file it after your wedding.</p>

<p>The marriage license can be completed at the courthouse, separating that from the wedding celebration, which you can still conduct. Amm was the first online church to really focus on weddings. As a wedding officiant, you are not part of the marriage license process. Please select your preferred ordination package. Know if your state or county allows or recognizes such a thing, particularly if the person is getting ordained online to be allowed to perform the vows on your wedding.</p>
