<p>Fast, easy and legal ordination to serve as a wedding officiant anywhere in the united states, with all required state and local credentials and registration documents plus free online training on how to conduct weddings. Per nevada revised statutes (nrs) 122.200, “any person who shall make a false statement in procuring a marriage license with reference to any matter required by nrs 122.040 and 122.050 to be stated under oath shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.” The state i live in requires certification to do that. Rules for becoming a nonreligious wedding officiant vary according to jurisdiction. The couple or the officiant must print the signed document and send it back to city hall within 5 business days of the wedding ceremony.</p>
