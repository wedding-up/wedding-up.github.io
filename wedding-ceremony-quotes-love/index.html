<p>Wedding quotes help in setting up the tone of invitation. Don�t get us wrong, we love a romantic quote about love and marriage but sometimes too much romance can get a little soppy. I mean, i suppose at the time i just thought of them as “mushy quotes about love,” but now that i’m a wedding designer, i realize that i’ve been collecting wedding quotes all along. A great marriage is not when the ‘perfect couple’ comes together. Over the years working as adventure wedding photographers we’ve heard some beautiful adventure wedding readings and quotes on love.</p>
