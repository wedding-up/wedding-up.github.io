<p>Bless this house by mary brahe and helen taylor is one of my absolute favorite wedding songs for a religious ceremony. They’re more or fewer songs of victory for the couple and everyone guest present. This bride entrance song is the perfect happy medium between a classical tune and something just a bit more modern. But that doesn�t mean you can�t make it feel personalized. The words are a prayer, asking god to bless the house that is.</p>
