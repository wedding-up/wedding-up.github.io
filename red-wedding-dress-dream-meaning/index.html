When you dream about any color you want to take into account what the color means in relation to your own feelings. Even if you�ve never spent a waking second planning your dream nuptials, your unconscious hours may still be full of dreams about weddings — as well as dreams about getting married, brides. Everyone loves the owner of this outfit and admires her kindness, charm and tenderness. What does it mean to dream of a wedding dress?</p>
