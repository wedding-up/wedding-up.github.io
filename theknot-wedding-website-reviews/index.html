<p>At the knot, we believe in one wedding tradition: The knot does indicate plus ones (which you aren�t @unaware, you�re a so), the couple just has to indicate when they set it up that the guest is getting a plus one. I love the visibility that the knot and weddingwire give me. Another recent story highlights the sometimes incestuous partnership the knot wedding website has with the many vendors who advertise through the site’s reach to engaged couples.
