<p>For a marriage to be considered valid in the state of georgia, couples must first obtain a marriage license, as in other states. My sister had a courthouse wedding, and there were about 9 witnesses there. A marriage license is a legal document obtained by a couple prior to marriage. You can find information on local civil weddings from your state’s or city’s.gov website, or at your city or county clerk’s office. Couples may choose any type of attire for a justice of the peace ceremony, but a traditional wedding gown and tux or suit is perfectly acceptable.</p>
