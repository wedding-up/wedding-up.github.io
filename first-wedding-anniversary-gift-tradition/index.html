<p>If you’re looking for a first wedding anniversary gift for a pair of bookworms, what could be cooler than this folded book art, featuring the couple’s wedding date? This one comes in a little pot and has a happy first anniversary card included. The traditional first anniversary gift for newlyweds is something made of paper. [citation needed] later, principally in the twentieth century, commercialism led to the addition of more anniversaries being represented by a named gift. Traditionally, 1st anniversary gifts are made from paper symbolising your u nwritten (and exciting) future ahead together.</p>
