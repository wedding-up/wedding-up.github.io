<p>I’m not italian by heritage but i married into an italian family. Mini meatballs, escarole, carrots, and acini di pepe pasta make this the best anytime soup!. Cook until tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve with crusty bread and a glass of wine and enjoy! I have no italian lineage and my mom never made it growing up, so for whatever reason it seemed easy to mess up.</p>

<p>Next, after setting the meatballs aside, you sauté the holy trinity of all cooking: The term “wedding” soup comes from the italian minestra maritata, “married soup”, referring to the flavor produced by the “marriage” or perfect blending of greens, broth and meat. But i’m here to tell you it is so easy to make and following this simple recipe people may likely think it was passed down from an italian grandmother. As per other�s suggestions i also recommend making the meatballs as small as you can roll them and have them stay together. I love italian wedding soup but to me the best part is the meatballs.</p>
