One thing we absolutely love is traveling to new cities and trying out different foods. (jump directly to the recipe.) folks often ask me if i have any formal training in cooking. It�s delicious and comforting, especially during these cold winter days just like my pasta fagioli/ pasta e fagioli soup (one pot) and italian meatball soup (one pot).</p>
